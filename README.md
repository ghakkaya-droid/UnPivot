This Python workshop is my first attempt.
In this project, I tried to understand how Python libraries work.
ChatGPT helped me a lot — the code was written by AI; I just tried to understand what it does.

The purpose of this code is to convert an Excel table from a pivoted format into a normal data table.
Normally, I use Power Query for this purpose, but with Python I no longer need to convert data manually or use the Power Query console.

Thanks for reading and for your attention.

Best regards,
Haluk Akkaya
